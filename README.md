# <b>Weather Dashboard</b>

## <b>Description</b>

In this project, we utilize the open weather API to retrieve information about the weather on a particular city. Local storage is also utilized in this application to store data that the user searched, and appends it in the left hand section. This is an application targeted towards travelers who wish to have an idea of how the weather might be when visiting and can plan accordingly, or simply users who are curious about the weather forecast for their city.


## <b>How to use</b>

The user simply needs to search the name of the city in mind in the search bar and select "Search". The application then reads what city/value is inside the search bar, and data is retrieved about that city using the open weather API. It then displays that information onto the webpage in two different sections. One is the current weather status that is displayed inside the rounded rectangular box, and the other is the 5 day forecast in displayed in order inside the cards directly below the current weather status. As mentioned previously, the application uses local storage to store user data and displays it in the history section as a button on the left hand side of the page, which a user can click on and refer back to a search they made previously.

## <b>Challenges</b>

One of the challenges was how to display the information using the API with the data that was retrieved. Another was how to use the local storage to create a button using the value of what was searched before, and when clicked on, the data then appears again without having to type and search that same city again. 

## <b>Future features</b>

One feature (which is already on the page) would be to add a clear button to remove all the existing data that is stored in local storage so the user data doesn't just sit there forever unless manually cleared out. Another feature would be to add a random city search generator, so a user who is curious about a particular cities weather (in the USA) can see the data based in that city. Finally, a styling feature I would add is depending on the weather for instance on a sunny day, the background color of the page would reflect to resemmble a sunny day or rainy day, etc.
